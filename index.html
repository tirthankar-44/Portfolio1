<div id="div1"><span><div class="e">Hello there, readers. Here's a lil' intro about myself. I see myself as a rational thinker, trying my best to think through things before every action I take.  
I always keep an open mindset, and am thrilled whenever presented with the opportunity of learning new skills. As soon as the college started, many such
 opportunities have presented themselves, including this one, which has led me 
to make my first ever website(Ta-Daa!). <br>My life's motto is to try and enjoy every moment, whilst continuously looking for opportunities of self-growth and learning more of this world I exist in.<br>
